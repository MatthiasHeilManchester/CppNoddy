Code styled using

astyle -s2 filename.cpp 

with the following ~/.astylerc

indent=spaces=2
style=ansi
brackets=break
indent-namespaces
break-elseifs
pad=oper
pad=paren-in
convert-tabs

Coding conventions:

1. A class's private/protected member data is all capitalised.
2. Private/protected member data that are pointers begin with 'p_'
3. Read only access to private member data is provided
by member functions beginning with 'get_'
4. Write only access uses the prefix 'set_'
5. Rather than get&set methods we use 'access_' to return
handles to member data that is read/write.
