\doxysubsubsection{What is it?}\label{index_intro1}
A simple (aka Noddy) collection of object orientated numerical routines written in C++, aimed at undergraduate projects and starting graduate students. In the current version, the test/example cases solve (amongst others)\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Two-\/dimensional parabolic problems ( eg., the unsteady boundary-\/layer equations ).
\item Boundary-\/value O\+DE problems ( eg., the Karman rotating-\/disk, Blasius boundary-\/layer and other similarity solutions ).
\item Arc-\/length continuation of problems involving limit points ( eg., the Karman rotating disk equations, Falkner-\/\+Skan equation, the plane Poiseuille flow linear neutral curve. ).
\item One-\/dimensional eigenvalue problems ( eg., the (bi-\/)harmonic equation, Orr-\/\+Sommerfeld equation ) solved both directly and via local methods.
\item One-\/dimensional hyperbolic problems ( eg., Sod\textquotesingle{}s shocktube problem, linear acoustic waves with reflection in non-\/uniform medium, shallow water eqiations ).
\item Two-\/dimensional hyperbolic problems ( eg., compressible Euler problems, linear acoustic waves, shallow water eqiations ).
\item Initial-\/boundary-\/value problems ( eg., the heat diffusion equation in 1D, and the unsteady Karman rotating-\/disk equations ).
\item Initial-\/value problems ( eg., the Lorenz equations ).
\item Poisson problems in Cartesian and cylindrical geometries.
\end{DoxyItemize}

A breakdown of examples into groups is found under the \textquotesingle{}Modules\textquotesingle{} link above. Alternatively, a complete list of examples can be found at this link \doxyref{Tests}{p.}{group__Tests}

The library provides\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Both \doxyref{dense vector }{p.}{classCppNoddy_1_1DenseVector} and \doxyref{sparse vector }{p.}{classCppNoddy_1_1SparseVector} classes (including the usual vector operations).
\item \doxyref{Dense }{p.}{classCppNoddy_1_1DenseMatrix}, \doxyref{banded }{p.}{classCppNoddy_1_1BandedMatrix} and \doxyref{sparse }{p.}{classCppNoddy_1_1SparseMatrix} matrix classes.
\item A class for \doxyref{O\+DE I\+V\+Ps }{p.}{classCppNoddy_1_1ODE__IVP} with 4th-\/order Runge-\/\+Kutta(-\/Fehlberg) method(s).

\item 2-\/D Poisson objects (\doxyref{Cartesian }{p.}{} and \doxyref{axisymmetric }{p.}{} cylindrical polars).
\item \doxyref{vector }{p.}{classCppNoddy_1_1Newton} Newton iteration classes.

\item An ability to link to selected B\+L\+AS, L\+A\+P\+A\+CK and P\+E\+T\+Sc routines via a simplified A\+PI (these currently include the real/complex generalised eigenproblem solvers, dense/banded/sparse LU solvers.).
\end{DoxyItemize}\doxysubsubsection{What is it for?}\label{index_intro2}
It exists for two reasons\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It\textquotesingle{}s an introduction/framework for final-\/year undergraduate project students or graduate students.
\item Just for fun.
\end{DoxyItemize}\doxysubsection{Getting and running it}\label{index_get0}
You need a machine with a recent C++ compiler and \textquotesingle{}git\textquotesingle{} to clone the latest version. The build system uses \textquotesingle{}meson\textquotesingle{}. The source is hosted on Github and can be obtained using \textquotesingle{}git\textquotesingle{} via \begin{DoxyVerb}  git clone git://github.com/hewitt/CppNoddy.git
\end{DoxyVerb}


A minimal install can be achieved via \begin{DoxyVerb}  meson --buildtype=debugoptimized build

  cd build

  ninja
\end{DoxyVerb}


The self-\/tests can be executed via \begin{DoxyVerb}  ninja tests
\end{DoxyVerb}


Optionally you can link to P\+E\+T\+Sc (for sparse matrix problems) and S\+L\+E\+Pc (for sparse matrix eigenvalue problems) via \begin{DoxyVerb}  meson configure -Dpetscz=true -Dslepc=true
\end{DoxyVerb}


for complex arithmetic, or \begin{DoxyVerb}  meson configure -Dpetscd=true -Dslepc=true
\end{DoxyVerb}


for real arithmetic. If P\+E\+T\+Sc/\+S\+L\+E\+Pc are not installed system-\/wide, you will need to set P\+K\+G\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+F\+I\+G\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH to point to P\+E\+T\+Sc.\+pc and S\+L\+E\+Pc.\+pc via \begin{DoxyVerb}  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PETSC_DIR/$PETSC_ARCH/lib/pkgconfig:$SLEPC/$PETSC_ARCH/lib/pkgconfig
\end{DoxyVerb}


assuming a bash shell. The environment variables \$\+P\+E\+T\+S\+C\+\_\+\+D\+IR/\$\+S\+L\+E\+P\+C\+\_\+\+D\+IR point to the base locations of the respective source trees, whilst \$\+P\+E\+T\+S\+C\+\_\+\+A\+R\+CH is the name of the build directory (assumed to be the same in both cases). Suggested configure options for P\+E\+T\+Sc are \begin{DoxyVerb} ./configure --download-superlu_dist --download-mpich --download-metis --download-parmetis --download-cmake --download-scalapack --download-mumps --with-scalar-type=complex
\end{DoxyVerb}


for complex arithmetic or use --with-\/scalar-\/type=real for real arithmetic.

See the \doxyref{Tests}{p.}{group__Tests} for a starting point.\doxysubsection{Is it fast/accurate?}\label{index_best0}
The matrix classes have native solvers that are naive unoptimised Gaussian elimination algorithms. These routines will only be practical (if at all!) for rather `small' matrix/band sizes and do not scale well. If the problem is of even moderate size, then you should link to your local L\+A\+P\+A\+C\+K/\+P\+E\+T\+Sc routines. L\+A\+P\+A\+C\+K/\+P\+E\+T\+Sc/\+S\+L\+E\+Pc libraries are not shipped with \doxyref{Cpp\+Noddy}{p.}{namespaceCppNoddy}, you have to install them separately yourself if they are not available by default.

The code is not especially optimised, in fact in many places the code is deliberately un-\/optimised for greater transparency; it is not intended for \textquotesingle{}heavy duty\textquotesingle{} problems. The only sanity checks applied are those listed in the test/example codes \doxyref{Tests}{p.}{group__Tests}.\doxysubsection{It made my machine burst into flames}\label{index_flames0}
I never said it wouldn\textquotesingle{}t ;-\/) The code comes with no guarantees.\doxysubsection{I think it needs a Cpp\+Noddy\+::foo$<$bar$>$ class}\label{index_add0}
Feel free to add something. If you\textquotesingle{}re an undergraduate looking for a final-\/year project or an M\+Sc. student and have an idea of something to include (or wish to redesign something that I did in a stupid way), then let me know.
