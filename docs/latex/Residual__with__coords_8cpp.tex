\doxysubsubsection{Detailed Description}
A specification of a (double/complex) residual class that not only defines a vector residual of a vector of state variables but may also depend upon N additional (double) variables. This is useful for the specification of boundary conditions in the P\+D\+E\+\_\+\+I\+B\+VP and P\+D\+E\+\_\+double\+\_\+\+I\+B\+VP classes where the boundary conditions are dependent on the time/spatial location.
